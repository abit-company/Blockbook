    <Paragraph>
      More and more often in recent years we have heard the media mention the
      term Bitcoin. Sometimes for the incredible fluctuations of value that have
      led to the comparison with the tulip bubble of 1637, others for its use in
      criminal activities (for example as a method of payment in ransomware). In
      the meantime, some people have begun to deepen this phenomenon, trying to
      understand how it was possible for people all over the world to transfer
      money without going through a financial institution. What they found was
      an open, public and secure system, where it was possible to innovate
      without asking permission from any institution: the Blockchain.

      with the promise of reducing costs and inefficiencies, radically
      transforming the business models we know today.
