    <Paragraph>
      In 1975 Steven Sasson, an engineer of the Eastman Kodak company, created
      what is considered to be the first digital camera. The company, at the
      time a leader in the chemical and film industry, told him to keep this
      invention private, worried about potential negative impacts on his
      business.

    <Paragraph>
      In 2007, Nokia was close to control 50% market share in the mobile phone
      industry (Source Gartner). Soon after, when Apple and Google started out
      with iOS and Android OS, Nokia did not understand the central role of
      software in smartphones, choosing not to concentrate their efforts on the
      evolution of their Symbian OS. In the meantime, Blackberry carry on the
      idea of using half of the mobile phone size for the keyboard. We all know
      how it ended.

    <Paragraph>
      History, especially in the digital age, is full of dominant societies that
      have ended up losing big opportunities, have been heavily downsized or
      failed due to their inability to fully understand the innovation that a
      new technology or new idea could have bring. New ideas have the power to
      destroy entire markets within a few years, just as Napster destroyed Tower
      Records simply by showing that it was possible to share music files
      between people. Napster has been closed, but once the world has understood
      the innovation behind it, no one has ever considered a record store as a
      profitable investment. Uber has created a new business model and, although
      regulators are trying to stop it, the idea of becoming a taxi driver is no
      longer very tempting.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Innovation canâ€™t be stopped, it is not possible to un-invent the internet,
      or the sharing economy. Innovation must be understood and embraced.
